The files are as follows:

### app.js

This is the main file, which provides a number of endpoints. Each of these are solutions to challenges set in the class and vary in difficulty.  As this is an entry level class, there should be something available here for all difficulty levels.

### data.csv and data2.csv

These are csv files that can be utilised by the ```/csv``` endpoint in ```app.js```

### webapp.html

This is a basic webapp demonstration for one of the challenges, which uses a ```<script>``` block in which to fetch data from an API and render it to the page
